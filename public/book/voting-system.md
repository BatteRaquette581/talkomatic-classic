# Voting System

Talkomatic uses a democratic system to manage disruptive users.

## How Voting Works
1. Click ðŸ‘Ž next to a username
2. Other users can also vote
3. Majority vote required for removal
4. Removed users cannot rejoin

> **Warning:** Voted-out users are banned from the room permanently.

## Important Notes
- Minimum 3 users required for voting
- Can't vote in rooms with 2 or fewer people
- Can't vote yourself out

> **Note:** Vote counts are visible to all room members.
