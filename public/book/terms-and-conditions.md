# Terms & Conditions

Welcome to the Talkomatic Bot Platform!  
By creating and deploying bots on Talkomatic, you agree to follow these essential terms and conditions to ensure a safe and fair experience for all users.

## Responsible Bot Usage

Bots must not be used to harm, disrupt, or abuse Talkomatic servers, users, or services.  
Specifically, you **must not**:

- Use bots to perform actions that may result in bans (including bot bans, IP bans, or account bans).
- Attempt to bypass security measures, spam rooms, or overload the server.
- Exploit any vulnerabilities or attempt to gain unauthorized access to restricted areas or user data.

## Rate Limits & Fair Use

- Always respect documented rate limits and avoid sending messages or events faster than allowed.
- Do **not** use bots to flood, spam, or automate excessive activity in chat rooms or across the platform.
- Bots that ignore rate limits or attempt to evade controls may be permanently banned without notice.

## User Responsibility

As the bot developer, you are responsible for all actions performed by your bot.  
Any abuse or misuse may result in penalties, including bans for your bot or your user account.

## Enforcement

Violating these terms may lead to immediate suspension or permanent banning of your bot, your IP address, and/or your user account.  
Talkomatic staff reserve the right to take action against any bot or user at their discretion.

## Updates to Terms

These terms may change at any time. Please review them regularly to stay updated.

> **Tip:** If you are unsure whether a bot action is allowed, ask before deploying it to production.
