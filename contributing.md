- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/MohdYahyaMahmodi/talkomatic-classic/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.

### Code Contributions

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Style Guide

- All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).
- Use ES6+ features when possible.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Only use `var` if absolutely necessary.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

### CSS Style Guide

### HTML Style Guide

- Always use double quotes for attributes.
- Avoid inline styles.

## Code Organization

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility.
- Organize files in a logical folder structure.
- Use meaningful names for files and folders.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Use comments to explain why, not what (the code should be self-explanatory).

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage percentage.
- Use Jest for JavaScript testing.

## Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template.
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Follow the JavaScript Style Guide.
- Document new code based on the Documentation Style Guide.
- End all files with a newline.

## Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation files.
